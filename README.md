### Hi there, I'm Danai! Unlocking cancer secrets, one cell at a time!  ðŸ‘‹

* I'm a data scientist / computational biologist working on genomic and (single-cell/spatial) transcriptomics to understand cancer.
* When I'm not exploring the fascinating world of data science and biology, you can find me catching flights, analyzing aviation data, or cheering on the court, applying data science insights to the game!
